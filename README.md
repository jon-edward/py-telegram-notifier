# py-telegram-notifier

A tool using the Telegram Bot API for sending messages to a Telegram chat by
a context manager, function call, or CLI.

## Installation

    pip install py-telegram-notifier

## Requirements

In order for the module to function, you must supply it with a bot
[token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#authorizing-your-bot), and a
[chat id](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#getupdates). Full instructions on creating a bot
can be found [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

## Usage as context manager

Firstly, set up the config for your Notifier. This only has to be done once, assuming you are
sending messages from the same bot to the same chat every time.

```python
from telegram_notifier import set_config_options

chat_id = 0000000000 # Your chat id
token = "0000000000" # Your bot token

set_config_options(chat_id=chat_id, token=token)
```

Then, you may use a Notifier as a context manager that will notify you of the type of exit
that was encountered, including whether it finished with or without an error.

```python
from telegram_notifier import Notifier

with Notifier("This is a task."):
    # Code that takes a long time.
    pass
```

## Usage as CLI

Save bot information in settings by using:

    telegram_notifier --chat_id XXXX --token YYYY

- `XXXX` the unique identifier for a target chat (chat id).
- `YYYY` the bot token.

Send a message to a chat once the settings are saved:

    telegram_notifier --message ZZZZ

- `ZZZZ` the message to send.
